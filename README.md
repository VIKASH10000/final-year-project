# CSE24-Machine-Learning-2024-Air-Quality-Monitoring
Air Quality has been predicted over Ghaziabad, India using classical machine learning algorithms as a part of the course requirement of CSE24 - Machine Learning at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College affiliated to Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, India.
The dataset containing various meteorological and air quality parameters was compiled using the CAMS GLobal Reanalysis Data - EAC4 (https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-reanalysis-eac4?tab=form). An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to visualize relationships between different features of the dataset. Correlation analysis & Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied on the dataset to select the most important features from the dataset. Various machine learning models such as linear models, kernel-based models, ensemble models were developed and evaluated via metrics such as r^2 score, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error using scikit-learn library of python. Gradient Boosting models were observed to perform best on the dataset.
And a special thanks to Mr. Yash Dahima.
