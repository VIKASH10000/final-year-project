# CSE24-Machine-Learning-2024-Air-Quality-Monitoring
Air Quality has been predicted over Ghaziabad, India using classical machine learning algorithms as a part of the course requirement of CSE24 - Machine Learning at Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College affiliated to Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, India.
The dataset containing various meteorological and air quality parameters was compiled using the CAMS GLobal Reanalysis Data - EAC4 (https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-reanalysis-eac4?tab=form). An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to visualize relationships between different features of the dataset. Correlation analysis & Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied on the dataset to select the most important features from the dataset. Various machine learning models such as linear models, kernel-based models, ensemble models were developed and evaluated via metrics such as r^2 score, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error using scikit-learn library of python. Gradient Boosting models were observed to perform best on the dataset.
And a special thanks to Mr. Yash Dahima.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to following things:

- User should have the knowledge about the air quality index and its related parameters
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the wrong place name is submitted.
- The input field is empty
  

### Built with

- Python
- Machine Learning
- Python Libraries



### What I learned

Completing this challenge has helped me improve my Frontend development skills such as:
- Responsive web design
- Writing semantic HTML5 markup
- Adding various web functionalities using JavaScript by manipulating the DOM

I've also been able to learn new things while completing the challenges, they include:
- Toggling a dropdown menu using vanilla javascript
- changing the color of an image using vanilla javascript
- Properly format a form using javascript



### Continued development

For my next projects, I'll be focusing on learning how to implement animations on drop down menus and change of 
image onclick.
